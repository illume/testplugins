# minikube

The [Minikube Headlamp Plugin](https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/plugins/tree/main/minikube) extends Headlamp so that it has support for the Minikube Kubernetes distribution.

[Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/) is a lightweight tool that simplifies the process of setting up a Kubernetes environment on your local PC. It provides a localStorage, single-node Kubernetes cluster that you can use for learning, development, and testing purposes.

Use minikube to run kubernetes locally on your laptop!

This is an alpha release. Please leave any feedback as a [github issue](https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/plugins/issues/new), or drop by the `#headlamp` channel on the Kubernetes slack.
